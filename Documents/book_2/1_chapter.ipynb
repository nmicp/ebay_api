    "The following flowcharts should help navigate the process of building the data pipeline. Specifics will not be highlighted in the roadmap, but will reference future chapters that dive into each section. Definitions of technical terms in this diagram can be found in chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1* highlights the general structure of how we built out this eBay data pipeline for research. The first step of getting data from eBay’s developer’s program was to get API keys. The steps of collecting these keys are described in the Understanding API chapter while the implementation of a Flask app is in chapter 3. This connection will only need to be completed once per project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we build the data pipeline in python script. This is highlighted in steps B through D - see the below diagrams. This recursive data collection method runs every 24 hours to collect the most up-to-date data from eBay categories of interest. This general procedure ranges from collecting the access keys to running an automated script. This algorithm consists of three main activities in an automated fashion: connecting to the desired API (Shopping and Finding API), mining the data, and saving the information in a SQL database. Specific background knowledge on these steps can be found in chapter “Getting Started with eBay’s API”. Implementation of this framework in python can be found in “Getting Data from eBay”. The last step of the roadmap — analysis — is open for social research. In the previous steps, we set-up a pipeline that cleans and stores data that is accessible through a csv file. In the analysis section, this csv file can be downloaded to be used in future analysis and research. Information on how to access the data for analysis can be found in “Accessing Data with Datasette”. \n",

    "**Diagram A** outlines the necessary steps to make an initial connection to eBay's API system and gain access to their data. First, interested parties are required to create a developer's program and apply for application access keys. They are then required to construct a RESTful API to communicate with eBay's system and receive developer tokens. These tokens are unique and should be stored in a secret .env file located in the same directory as the other project scripts. More information regarding getting access to eBay’s API can be found in the beginning of chapter 3. \n",

    "**Diagram B** describes the need of having a basic understanding of the functions of eBay’s API and documentation. In general, once a successful connection to eBay has been established, users will need to read through and understand eBay's documentation and syntax to interface with APIs of interest. For our use case, the Finding and Shopping APIs to get data for our features of interest. More specific information about the language of the eBay developer’s program can be found in chapter 2. \n",

The extracted raw data is converted to a tabular format, and other cleaning processes are performed using a series of nested loops. Details on the code that implements this can be found in chapter 3. This section describes the recursive nature that is completed automatically every day when script runs to collect data from eBay. \n",

A permanent storage space comes in the form of tables in a dedicated SQL database. If the table does not exist, it must be created. However, if the table already exists then the processed data is simply appended to it. We create a table once, and keep updating the table with the newest data we collect each day. This recursive nature of storing data can be found in chapter 3. \n",

    "### **Key Concepts** \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter aims to explain key concepts essential to the automated data collection process through eBay’s API. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Data Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types are an important aspect in programming that help determine the type of the object’s value. Some examples include numeric, alphanumeric, decimal values. Their differences lie in the types of operations the computer system can perform.    \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of data types. Generally, data types can be classified into two categories: primitive/structure and composite. Primitive data types are native to the processor; they have a one-to-one correspondence with objects in the computer’s memory (a common data type of this class is an integer – whole number). Composite data types are constructed in the program out of primitive data types and other aggregate data types. A dictionary is an example of this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, let us start by describing the main data types used in the eBay documentation and how these concepts might differ from ordinary use. For example, the use of float and decimal types in the world of programming and in eBay's APIs may differ. Intuitively, we may think that a float is used as a decimal number in the calculator; however, an eBay decimal type contains different elements that are not necessarily numbers separated by decimal points. Therefore, as the meanings of data types can vary, we will explain them throughout this manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Tip:</b> Missing data on eBay results in the key:value pairs sometimes not existing for specific listings. Missing data from eBay results in missing data in the dataframe. This missing data is read into the python table as a missing data type. However, when stored into a SQL database, this variable type is changed into a string (words) that state “None”. Since SQL databases do not allow missing rows, we substitute this as a word highlighting missing data. In future analysis, one can filter the “None” text to remove missing values.</div>\n",

    "API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. APIs serve as intermediaries through an online connection or set of programming codes. For example: a server receives a data query, parses responses, and sends instructions between a data provider and an end-user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this intermediary role, APIs use standards, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and other Internet applications. APIs use different types of files to access information, such as XML and JSON format files. We will explain those file types in future sections.  \n",

    "XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. We use it to store and transport data. XML facilitates communication between humans and machines. Due to its easy-to-read to read format, it is widely developed in APIs. This language uses a serialization process (translating a data type into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted over a computer network to be later reconstructed in a different environment). The versatility of this format is highly appealing in the API data collection.    \n",

    "JSON is a text-based data format for storing and exchanging information.  JSON data are used to send HTTP requests between applications. They are structured as a collection of key-value pairs, in which the key must be a type string followed by one of the following data types: numbers, boolean, array, etc. (See description of data types)\n",

The controller oversees running on login nodes, scheduling, and monitoring the jobs in each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slurm makes it easy for users to perform jobs in an automated manner in a time frame without the need to be present to review the process. For example, we scheduled a job to acquire seniority data for this capstone project starting at midnight. This facilitated the data collection, given the company’s policy of restricting daily calls to the Shopping API to 5,000 calls.\n",

Each table contains columns and rows with a primary key identifying each row. Columns are attributes of labeled elements. Rows represent single items that belong to a type of entity.  The organization of a relational database must provide derivability, redundancy, and consistency in the data. See *figure 2* below\n",
