    "### **Introduction to the eBay Data Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will provide a detailed overview of the implementation of a data pipeline. This process begins by collecting keys from eBay’s Developer Program, and ends in a cleaned data frame that is connected to a SQLite database.  Figure 3 provides a holistic overview of our data pipeline process. Orange elements within the inner rectangle are applied to each category in our predefined <code>categories_list</code>. The looping structure of the flowchart represents the automated nature of this entire process, which runs once every 24 hours. We start by loading in the developer keys provided by eBay and connecting to their API system. Developer’s keys are a username and password that is unique to each user of eBay’s developer’s program. These keys are unique to each user and act as identifiers for users when accessing the API systems. The purpose of this is for eBay to keep track of who is accessing what at any given time, and as such, developer keys should be stored in a hidden .env file as a prerequisite of the loading process. Using .env files is a customary method for storing private information, and often reside in the same directory as the main code files. It is important to not share your keys with anyone!\n",
    " \n",
    "Once we gain access to eBay’s API system, we define the <code>geteBay</code> function. This function intakes a category number as an input, and subsequently connects to and makes GET request calls to the Finding API. This function must be defined before the iterative process described below can be completed. Specifics on how this function works will be provided in future chapters. \n",
    " \n",
    "Once the  <code>geteBay</code> function  has been defined, we iteratively loop over each of the categories in <code>categories_list</code>, and each element is passed through the <code>geteBay</code> function. The <code>geteBay</code> function contains loops that extracts each of the desired features and cleans the associated data for each listing. The cleaned data is then stored in a new data frame.\n",
    " \n",
    "After the cleaned data frame is generated, we extract the <code>Item_ID</code> for each listing and use the resulting list as an input parameter to our second API connection with the Shopping API. The subsequent GET request calls allows us to mine further features of interest for each of the listings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>category_id</code>\n",
    "- <code>item_specs</code>\n",
    "- <code>item_idlist</code>\n",
    "- <code>seller_id</code>\n",
    "- <code>Item_sku</code> \n",
    "- <code>image_url</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we merge the processed data from the Finding and Shopping APIs into a single data frame called <code>item_specs</code>.\n",
    " \n",
    "We then connect to our SQL database, ebay.db, and listings in the newly merged <code>item_specs</code> data frame are appended to the item_specs table. Once the new data has successfully been appended to the database table, all changes are saved and the connection to the database is closed. This process then repeats the following day at 12.05am.\n",

The inner box indicates a comprehensive process to collect for each category. Then, the data is concatenated and the collection process is automated each 24 hours. \n",

    "\n",
    "Getting access to eBay’s developer’s program requires users to build their own application. This requirement is a result of eBay’s marketplace account <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/marketplace-account-deletion\"> deletion notification update </a>. The resulting application provides eBay with a communication channel to notify developers of marketplace deletion notifications. The architecture the application requires is relatively simple – it needs to receive eBay challenge code and respond with an output that hashes together the challenge code, the user’s eBay verification token, and the application’s endpoint. A 200 response should be produced in an output field in JSON format. An application that meets these requirements can be constructed in python using the flask package.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be reiterated that creating an application that can successfully receive challenge code is essential to accessing eBay’s production data. Production data consists of real listings from live marketplaces. Users can also develop test code to interact with eBay’s API system through their Sandbox environment.\n",

    "The Flask application must be able to manage Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) requests. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between two applications. The method we used to get an https connection was through letsencrypt.com, which is a third-party website that provides a certificate to most hosted websites. The user needs to purchase a domain name in order to obtain an SSL certificate. Domains can be purchased through godaddy, Google domains, or other websites. There is no restriction on extensions. For example, we used a .club extension due to its low set up cost. After securing an SSL hosted domain for the application, login to eBay’s developer’s program and apply for Production Keys. Once Production Keys are obtained, you are ready to start building your data pipeline.\n",

    "## **Navigating through the Code** \n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains information on our specific implementation of a data pipeline that extracts data from eBay, cleans the data, and uploads it to a database. The script was written in Python, and lives on a high performance computing system (Rivanna). Access to the script and the computing system was established before the project was handed off to stakeholders. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. The specific structure of Python is similar to R in that it includes variable names and functions built into the language. In this python script, we go through a detailed description of the code we implement. This is a specific use-case of the data pipeline that extracts data from the predefined categories of interest we defined earlier. To troubleshoot Python errors, Google and StackOverflow — a question and answer website for programming — can be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section is meant to provide a general overview of the code in our main data mining and processing script. To help reinforce user understanding, we have included images of code blocks, which we reference throughout this tutorial. In our code blocks, we also include comments on where one can edit variables for different use-cases of our data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any python script, we will begin by importing the necessary packages and loading the API keys into our environment. Packages are replicable actions that take place in Python. These are open-source, and their documentation on how to implement specific packages can be researched online. In the code that imports the packages that we use in our script, we also import a separate python script that contains our categories of interest. Notice that <code>categories_of_interest</code> is imported from another .py file, <code>CategoryList_Input</code>. This file resides in the same directory as our main .py file, and provides a method for our sponsors to freely modify categories of interest without interfacing with the main script. If you want to change the categories, simply open the <code>CategoryList_Input</code> python file, and change the category ids to those you want to search over. Throughout the script, we will directly reference where some specific packages are. \n",
    "\n",
    "With our implementation of this Python script, blue colored code are functions that are built into packages. Red colored code represents strings, and green code represents built in python functions not from specific packages. It is best practice to not name new variables anything that appears in green or blue, as that might overwrite the default system. \n",

    "After loading in our account-specific keys, an initial connection is made to the eBay API system. This establishes a general connection to eBay’s APIs. When accessing specific APIs to extract features of interest, we will have to establish other connections.  This general connection to eBay allows us to have a secure flow of data, while eBay can also keep track of the details on who is using their data. This initial setup includes getting the private keys connected to the script. These private keys are stored in a text file in the same folder that the script exists in. Other variables created including <code>url</code>, <code>headers</code>, and <code>params</code> are used to specify our connection to eBay. The <code>request.post()</code> function is the final step in creating the secure request to connect to eBay’s API. \n",

    "\n",
    "We use a batch script to automate the data collection process. The term script is used throughout this section to mean an executable file that you create and submit to a job scheduler. In essence, this script is an automated system that will run the data collection process at a user specified time. Sbatch submits a batch script to Slurm and allows us to recursively run our main pythonic script to collect data. This slurm file should have the extension slurm_file_name.slurm. Setting up the slurm file to run on a daily basis requires several parameters listed below. These commands tell the job scheduler what to do. These options and their use cases can be added to the body of the slurm file in order to customize its functionality. The specific implementation of this slurm file to collect data from eBay everyday at midnight can be seen in the code chunk below. We choose certain parameters that will work well with eBay’s call limits. \n",

    "    \n",
    "<code>#SBATCH -t 03:00:00</code>    \n",
    "The -t parameter sets the time limit for which the job will stop running. For this wall clock time limit, the job will run for a maximum of 3 hours. \n",

This can be accomplished by opening a terminal (via file > new > terminal on Rivanna) and checking to see if the <code>pwd</code> (present working directory) matches the location of interest. To navigate to the correct directory use type in cd followed by the location of interest. Once you have confirmed that you are in the correct directory, type the function “sbatch slurm_file_name.slurm”. Hit enter, and if successful, the following message should appear “submitted batch job [number]”. \n",

    "This documentation provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of the implementation of a data pipeline for social research. This data pipeline makes a connection to eBay’s developer’s program, connects to the appropriate APIs, collects data, and stores data. This pipeline also provides a dashboard for accessing and saving the data for future works. When editing the data pipeline, the “Navigating the Code” chapter will be useful in understanding the specific implementation of Python code. General Python errors that appear can be researched on Google or StakeOverflow. Connection errors to eBay’s developer program can be researched on eBay’s documentation. The implementation of this data pipeline will allow for social search to collect up-to-date data on categories of interest across eBay, and can be edited for more specific use-cases. "
